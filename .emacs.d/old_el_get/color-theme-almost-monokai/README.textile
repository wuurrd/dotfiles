h2. How do I try it out?

# Copy the @color-theme-almost-monokai.el@ file to your emacs plugin directory (if you have one), or simply drop it somewhere you know.
# Lets say you place it in @~/foo@
# Next, open your @.emacs@ file, and add to it:

<pre><code>(load-file "~/foo/color-theme-almost-monokai.el")
(color-theme-almost-monokai)</code></pre>

h2. What do I need?

* Emacs 21 or higher
* "Color Theme support":http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme

h2. Any license?
